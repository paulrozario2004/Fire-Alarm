# ðŸ”¥ Fire Alarm System using Arduino, Gas Sensor, and Flame Sensor

This project is a basic yet powerful **fire detection and alert system** developed using an **Arduino Uno**, an **MQ-2 gas sensor**, and an **IR flame sensor**. It monitors the surrounding environment for flammable gases and visible flames, and triggers an alert using a buzzer when danger is detected.

## ðŸ“· Project Overview

The system is designed to:
- **Detect gas leaks** using the MQ-2 sensor (e.g., smoke, LPG, methane)
- **Detect open flames** using an IR-based flame sensor
- **Trigger an alarm** (via buzzer) when either hazard is detected
- Provide **serial monitor output** for real-time readings and debugging

## ðŸ§ª How to Test

1. Power the Arduino through USB or an external battery.
2. Open the Serial Monitor to observe real-time gas and flame data.
3. Use a lighter (without lighting it) near the flame sensor to simulate a flame.
4. Release a small amount of gas or smoke near the gas sensor (in a ventilated area).
5. When fire or gas is detected, the buzzer will sound.

## ðŸš€ Future Enhancements

- Add SMS alert capability using a GSM module (e.g., SIM800L)
- Add internet connectivity using ESP8266/ESP32 for remote alerts
- Connect a relay module to control electrical appliances
- Cloud integration (ThingSpeak, Firebase) for real-time monitoring
- Battery backup using Li-ion or 9V rechargeable battery pack
